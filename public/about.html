<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Alliaster Wentzel, I’m at this moment 34years old. Funny enough as I was typing that, I wanted to type 32. Funny how time flies hey. We don’t really want to get old lol but anyway. I’m currently a Desktop Publisher at a very well-known printing company. I’m actually studying to be a Web Developer. There is so many reasons why I decided to run down that path.</p>
<p>After I’ve gotten divorced, yes lol I’m divorced. I decided to change my life or at least myself, work on some personal development. I came across Foreign Exchange, thought I'll make it as a forex trader. Worked on this for almost 4years didn’t get any better made some money here and there but nothing life changing. While I was doing that, I was reading some self-development books which really helped me have a more positive outlook on life. As I’m saying this, I still believe I’ll be a really good profitable Forex trader. One Day!</p>
<p>4years in forex trading and I’ve learnt so much made a lot of changes, strategies and I finally came across a strategy that can change my life and out of the blue manager called me in. “Hey I see you’ve been doing other things while you supposed to be working.” ☹ yes, that happened. Now can’t be a day trader anymore, again back to the drawing board. This is actually one of the reasons why I wanted to become a Web Developer to able to work from home and be the trader I was meant to be. </p>
<p>I started getting into Web Development and it was mind blowing. I decided to put all my focus on it and maybe someday I can build a robot that can trade for me. Let’s see.</p>
